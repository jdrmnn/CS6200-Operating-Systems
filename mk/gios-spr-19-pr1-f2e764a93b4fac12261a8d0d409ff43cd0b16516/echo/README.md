the handler invokes gfs_send and gfs_sendheader which you then send over the socket connection.  Hence the interface to the handler: your context block (where you store things like the socket descriptor), the path name of the file being requested, and the context that was registered with you (the handler_arg).  This is a division of responsibilities model that is a common design pattern in systems code where we wish to have multiple implementations of specific functionality.  While this is a small project, the structure is to help you understand the design pattern.
